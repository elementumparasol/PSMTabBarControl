# PSMTabBarControl

My attempt to bring the infamous cocoa component to the modern Objective-C platform. The initial code importation is based on zachwaugh/PSMTabBarControl@823eb00c00d3b9233c7dbd27145867be9a4eb341.

## Features
* Cleaned-up codebase
* Converted to ARC
* Entirely new demo app

# Installation
* Drag the `PSMTabBarControl/PSMTabBarControl` folder into your project.
  * _If your project **does not use ARC** you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag for every files from PSMTabBarControl in `Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources`._    

# Credits
This new version of PSMTabBarControl is brought to your by [Jean-Philippe Couture](mailto://jcouture@gmail.com). Previous work on PSMTabBarControl was done by Zach Waugh of [Giant Comet, LLC](http://giantcomet.com/) and John Pannell of [Positive Spin Media, Inc](http://www.positivespinmedia.com/).
