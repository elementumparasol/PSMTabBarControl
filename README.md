# PSMTabBarControl

Bringing the infamous cocoa component to a more modern Objective-C life. The initial code importation is based on [zachwaugh/PSMTabBarControl@823eb00c00d3b9233c7dbd27145867be9a4eb341](https://github.com/zachwaugh/PSMTabBarControl/commit/823eb00c00d3b9233c7dbd27145867be9a4eb341).

PSMTabBarControl provides a user interface for the management of NSTabView components.

## Features
* Codebase clean-up (ongoing)
* Conversion to ARC
* Entirely new demo app!

# Installation
* Drag the `PSMTabBarControl/PSMTabBarControl` folder into your project.
  * _If your project **does not use ARC** you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag for every files from PSMTabBarControl in `Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Sources`._
  
# Usage

* You need an instance of an NSTabView (with the tabless style and without pre-existing tabs for best results)
* Connect the PSMTabBarControl `tabView` property to the instance of NSTabView (either via Interface Builder or programmatically)
* Set the NSTabView `delegate` property to the instance of PSMTabBarControl (either via Interface Builder or programmatically)

The PSMTabBarControl instance should occupy the width of the window, and should be precisely 24 pixels in height. It should be resizable in width, but not height.
